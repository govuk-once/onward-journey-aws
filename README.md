# Onward Journey (AWS Hosted)

## Summary
A prototype for connecting users to further support after a chat session can't produce a satisfactory answer, hosted on AWS

For detailed information on the infrastructure architecture, environment isolation, and database management, please refer to the [Infrastructure README](infrastructure/README.md).

## Getting started

### Pre-requisites

This project uses [mise-en-place](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html) to manage runtime versions

After installing `mise`, you should run `mise activate` from the root of this repo or [set up your shell to automatically activate mise on startup](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html#activate-mise), then run `mise install`

You should also install all the tools from the [laptop-configuration repo](https://github.com/govuk-once/laptop-configuration)

Install the pre-commit hooks with `pre-commit install`. This will run the hooks listed in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` before each commit

## Deploying infrastructure

You need to have the gds cli installed and configured to be able to deploy infrastructure, to the point that `gds aws once-onwardjourney-development-readonly -- echo "test"` succeeds

We use the gds cli to assume roles on our development machines, for a list of relevant roles see `gds aws | grep onwardjourney`. You use one of these roles when working with terraform by running e.g. `gds aws <role-name> -- terraform plan`, or you can run `gds aws <role-name> -- $SHELL` to start a new shell session authenticated as the relevant role

You will need to create a configuration file for the terraform backend for each target AWS account. Do this by copying `environments/.example.config` to `environments/<environment name>.config`, and filling in the placeholders

You will also need to set the environment name in `infrastructure/local.auto.tfvars`:
```shell
echo 'environment = "<environment name>" >> local.auto.tfvars'
```

You need to initialise the terraform in the `infrastructure/` directory before you can deploy. You will also need to run this when you change what AWS account you are targeting, e.g. from development to staging
```shell
# Run within an authenticated session from from `gds aws`
terraform init -reconfigure -backend-config=environments/<environment name>.config
```

When running `terraform init` for the first time, you will be prompted via the CLI to provide backend configuration values to locate the existing TF state bucket. Enter them in the following format, replacing the account number and environment name (usually your initials for dev):

```text
Initializing the backend...
bucket
  The name of the S3 bucket

  Enter a value: govuk-once-onwardjourney-development-<aws account number>-tfstate

key
  The path to the state file inside the bucket

  Enter a value: environment/<environment name>
```

You can switch workspaces to deploy an entirely different instance, for example to test changes in an isolated environment without affecting the default workspace:
```shell
# View existing and selected workspace
terraform workspace list
# Create a new workspace
terraform workspace new foo
```

To view what changes your terraform code will make:
```shell
terraform plan
```

If you are happy with these changes:
```shell
terraform apply
```

To destroy an environment:
```shell
terraform destroy
```
